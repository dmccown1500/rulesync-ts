## [1.1.2] - 2025-08-01

### Added

- **New Template**: Added `base/no-sycophancy` template for direct, honest AI communication without excessive praise

### Fixed

- **Critical Bug**: Fixed template directory path resolution when package is installed via npm
  - ComposeCommand and TemplatesCommand now use package-relative paths instead of `process.cwd()`
  - Templates directory is now correctly located at `__dirname + '/../../templates'`
  - This resolves the issue where npm-installed packages couldn't find their templates
- **Test Suite**: Updated ComposeCommand tests to work with new path resolution logic
  - Fixed path mocking to handle `__dirname`-based template paths
  - Added tests to verify path resolution works regardless of user working directory
  - All 213 tests now pass with the updated path resolution
- **Documentation**: Fixed README.md links and table of contents
  - Moved `[Agent Management](#agent-management)` link outside code block where it works as clickable link
  - Removed broken "Global vs Local Configuration" table of contents entry
  - All documentation links now function properly
- **CLI Help Text**: Improved command help accuracy and formatting
  - Updated main description to reflect 12 supported AI assistants
  - Enhanced Quick Start to prioritize template-based workflow
  - Fixed parameter naming consistency in agents enable/disable commands
  - Added clear step-by-step instructions for both template and custom workflows
- **Directory References**: Fixed remaining "examples" references that should be "templates"
  - Updated GenerateCommand test to use `/test/templates/` instead of `/test/examples/`
  - All directory references now consistent with examples → templates rename

### Removed

- **install.sh** - Obsolete installation script (users should use `npm install -g rulesync-ts`)
  - Updated .npmignore to remove reference to deleted file

### Technical Details

- Changed from `process.cwd() + '/templates'` to `path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', 'templates')`
- Ensures templates are found relative to package installation directory, not user's current working directory
- Maintains backward compatibility for all existing functionality
- Updated template count references from 25+ to 28+ templates across documentation and CLI help

## [1.1.1] - 2025-07-31

### Fixed

- **Package Distribution**: Updated .npmignore to exclude deleted files (RELEASE_NOTES.md, EXAMPLE.md, PUBLISHING.md)
- **Git Ignore**: Removed duplicate `dist` entry and added generated rule files from development/testing
- **NPM Package**: Added new generated agent files to .npmignore (.aider.conf.yml, .continue/, .amazonq/, .vscode/cody.json)

### Technical Improvements

- Cleaner npm package distribution with only necessary files
- Better development workflow with proper ignore patterns

## [1.1.0] - 2025-07-31

### Added

- **4 New AI Assistants** - Expanded from 8 to 12 total supported assistants:
  - Aider → `.aider.conf.yml`
  - Continue.dev → `.continue/config.json`
  - Amazon Q Developer → `.amazonq/rules/coding-guidelines.md`
  - Sourcegraph Cody → `.vscode/cody.json`
- **New CLI Commands**:
  - `rulesync agents` - List and manage AI assistants (replaces `rules:list`)
  - `rulesync templates` - Browse available rule templates (replaces `examples`)
  - `rulesync compose` - Template-based rule composition system
- **Template System** - 28+ pre-built templates organized by category:
  - **Base templates**: clean-code, security, testing, documentation, performance, accessibility
  - **Language templates**: typescript, python, go, java, rust, csharp, php, swift, kotlin
  - **Framework templates**: react, django, express, nextjs, angular, vue, nodejs, rails, spring, laravel, flutter, fastapi, svelte
- **Content Filtering Service** - Intelligent content processing for rule composition
- **Comprehensive Documentation**:
  - Complete README.md overhaul with table of contents and cross-references
  - Explicit template listings (no more vague "And more" references)
  - User-focused quick start guide and workflow examples

### Changed

- **Terminology**: Renamed "rules" to "agents" throughout codebase for clarity
- **Directory Structure**: `src/rules/` → `src/agents/`, `examples/` → `templates/`
- **Test Organization**: Reorganized tests into logical directories (agents/, commands/, services/)
- **Dependencies**: Optimized for better compatibility and reduced conflicts:
  - axios: ^1.6.2 → ^1.10.0
  - chalk: ^5.3.0 → ^4.1.2 (CommonJS compatible)
  - inquirer: ^9.2.12 → ^8.2.6 (CommonJS compatible)
  - fs-extra: ^11.2.0 → ^11.3.0
- **Package Distribution**: Updated to include templates/ directory and exclude EXAMPLE.md

### Deprecated

- `rulesync rules:list` - Use `rulesync agents` instead (backwards compatible)
- `rulesync enable <rule>` - Use `rulesync agents enable <agent>` instead (backwards compatible)
- `rulesync disable <rule>` - Use `rulesync agents disable <agent>` instead (backwards compatible)

### Removed

- **EXAMPLE.md** - Consolidated into comprehensive README.md

### Fixed

- **Critical Security**: Updated form-data dependency to fix GHSA-fjxv-7rqg-78g4 vulnerability
- **Code Formatting**: Applied consistent Prettier formatting across all agent files
- **Test Coverage**: Updated all tests to reflect 12 agents instead of 8
- **Internal Links**: Fixed all cross-references in documentation

### Technical Improvements

- **100% Test Coverage**: 211 tests across 14 test suites
- **Zero Vulnerabilities**: All security issues resolved
- **Better Compatibility**: Eliminated ESM/CommonJS conflicts
- **Performance**: Reduced package bloat (52 fewer packages installed)
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript interfaces and error handling

### Backwards Compatibility

- All existing CLI commands continue to work unchanged
- Generated file locations remain the same
- Configuration file format unchanged
- All existing workflows remain functional
