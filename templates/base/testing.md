# Testing Best Practices

## Testing Strategy
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Write tests first when possible
- Test at multiple levels: unit, integration, end-to-end
- Focus on critical business logic
- Maintain test independence

## Test Structure
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Use descriptive test names
- One assertion per test
- Group related tests together
- Keep tests simple and focused

## Test Coverage
- Aim for high coverage on critical paths
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Don't chase 100% coverage blindly
- Focus on business-critical functionality
- Include performance and security tests

## Test Data
- Use factories for consistent test data
- Clean up after tests
- Use realistic but not production data
- Isolate tests from external dependencies
- Make tests deterministic

## Mocking
- Mock external dependencies
- Don't mock what you don't own
- Verify interactions when relevant
- Use stubs for simple return values
- Keep mocks simple and focused

## Maintenance
- Keep tests clean and readable
- Update tests when requirements change
- Remove obsolete tests
- Refactor test code like production code
- Monitor test execution time
