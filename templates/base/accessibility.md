## Visual Design
- Maintain sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 minimum)

- Provide multiple visual indicators

## Interactive Elements
- Make clickable areas large enough (44px minimum)
- Provide feedback for user actions
- Use consistent interaction patterns
- Include loading states and progress indicators
- Handle errors gracefully with clear messaging

## Testing
- Test with keyboard-only navigation
- Use automated accessibility testing tools
- Test with actual screen readers
